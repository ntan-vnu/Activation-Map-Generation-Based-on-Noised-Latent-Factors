Activation Map Generation Based on Noised Latent Factors for Medical Image Classification

The project is implemented regarding the proposed methodology presented in the paper entitled "Activation Map Generation Based on Noised Latent Factors for Medical Image Classification". In the research, the authors discuss an approach to discover class activation maps of medical images based on noised latent factors learned by typical convolutional neural networks.
